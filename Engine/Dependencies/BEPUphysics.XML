            <summary>
            Broad phase implementation that partitions objects into a 2d grid, and then performs a sort and sweep on the final axis.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This broad phase typically has very good collision performance and scales well with multithreading, but its query times can sometimes be worse than tree-based systems
            since it must scan cells.  Keeping rays as short as possible helps avoid unnecessary cell checks.
            The performance can degrade noticeably in some situations involving significant off-axis motion.

            In small scenarios, it can be the quickest option.  It uses very little memory.

            Gets or sets the sidedness of the shape.  This is a convenience property based on the Solidity property.
            If the shape is solid, this returns whatever sidedness is computed to make the triangles of the shape face outward.
            If the shape is solid, setting this property will change the sidedness that is used while the shape is solid.

            Very few manifolds actually make use of this. It exists solely as a hack to compensate for other design limitations surrounding collision detection APIs

            Constraint made from other constraints.
            Putting constraints into a solver group can help with organization and, in some cases, performance.
            
            If you have multiple constraints between the same two entities, putting the constraints into a 
            CustomizableSolverGroup can lower lock contention.
            
            Be careful about overloading a single solvergroup; it should be kept relatively small to ensure that the multithreading loads stay balanced.

             Gets the buffered states of the entity.  If the Space.BufferedStates manager is enabled,
             this property provides access to the buffered and interpolated states of the entity.
             Buffered states are the most recent completed update values, while interpolated states are the previous values blended
             with the current frame's values.  Interpolated states are helpful when updating the engine with internal time stepping, 
             giving entity motion a smooth appearance even when updates aren't occurring consistently every frame.  
             Both are buffered for asynchronous access.

        <member name="P:BEPUphysics.Settings.CollisionDetectionSettings.ContactInvalidationLength">
            <summary>
            For persistent manifolds, contacts are represented by an offset in local space of two colliding bodies.
            The distance between these offsets transformed into world space and projected onto a plane defined by the contact normal squared is compared against this value.
            If this value is exceeded, the contact is removed from the contact manifold.
            
            If the world is smaller or larger than 'normal' for the engine, adjusting this value proportionally can improve contact caching behavior.
            The default value of .1f works well for worlds that operate on the order of 1 unit.

            In regular convex manifolds, two contacts are considered redundant if their positions are too close together.  
            In nonconvex manifolds, the normal must also be tested, since a contact in the same location could have a different normal.

            Length of each integration step.  Calling a Space's Update() method moves time forward this much.
            The other method, Space.Update(float), will try to move time forward by the amount specified in the parameter by taking steps of TimeStepDuration size.
            Defaults to 1/60.
